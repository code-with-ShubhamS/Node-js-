If we declare any no like 012 is will be declared as a octal no system 
To convert it into decimal 
   0o12 => 2* 8pow0 + 1* 8pow1 = 10 


   But this is depricated so we use 0o12 
   In octal No we can only use no from 0 to 7;
   0o12348 it is invalid 

   Another way to convert a octal no to decimal
   parseInt("5643245",8);


   Decimal to ocatal 
   123.toString(8);

   Why we use base 8? because in octal no system there are total 8 character which we are used
