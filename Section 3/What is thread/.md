1. Concurrency => Means at a particular instance a thread get the cpu to execute its task . when we run multiple thread in the core and there is only one core which execute the thread then they run concurrently first thread come to execute for a millisecond and than second thread come to execute for a milliseconds .In this overall time of executing threads is same but the application is not bloked 

2. Parlalism => Means we run multiple threads in multiple core parallely.Which take less time but cpu use is increased .

Core => we have physically 6 core and 12 locial core which run the processes or threads 
A thread, on the other hand, is a logical software unit that can run on a single core.



# Remember
Node.js is mainly single-threaded, running JavaScript on a single thread with an event loop, ideal for I/O-bound tasks. However, it can be multi-threaded using libuv's thread pool for background tasks and the worker_threads module for parallel execution, allowing it to handle CPU-intensive tasks while keeping the main event loop single-threaded.

node is single threaded but for handling blocking requests it can be multithreaded


# Can a Process Exist without a thread
By Default there is one thread automatially generated with the process . And thread go to the core to run their program. 

# we can Debugg the workers thread
