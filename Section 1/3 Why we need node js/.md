Why do we need Node.js & how is it different from JS in browser?


Node.js extends the capabilities of JavaScript beyond what is possible when running JavaScript solely in a browser environment. Here's what Node.js can do that normal JavaScript cannot, which makes it suitable for building backends.

1. Access to File System

Node.js: Provides APIs to interact with the file system, allowing you to read, write, delete, and manipulate files and directories on the server.

Normal JavaScript: In a browser, JavaScript is sandboxed for security reasons, meaning it cannot directly access the file system of the client device.

2. Networking Capabilities

Node.js: Enables the creation of web servers, handles network requests, and supports low-level networking features like creating TCP/UDP servers, handling sockets, etc.

Normal JavaScript: In the browser, JavaScript can make HTTP requests (via fetch or XMLHttpRequest), but it cannot create servers or handle low-level networking tasks.


3. Process Management

Node.js: Can spawn child processes, manage multiple threads, and handle system-level tasks like interacting with operating system processes.
like we can open any thing jasa chrome,firefox using node js command start chrome

Normal JavaScript: In the browser, JavaScript is limited to running in a single thread and cannot spawn processes or directly interact with the operating system.


4. Interacting with Operating System

Node.js: Can interact with the operating system to perform tasks like reading environment variables, interacting with system processes, scheduling tasks, etc.
Normal JavaScript: In the browser, JavaScript is sandboxed and cannot interact with the operating system directly, limiting its capabilities to browser-related tasks.
