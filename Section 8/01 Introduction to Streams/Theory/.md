So in buffer we have some limitation like we are reading file which is of 10gb and our ram is only 8gb so thay create a problem and our node js system is crashed .Than we use streams.

Reading a file and writing that file require ram space.

# Streams

Stream send data in the form of small chunks(Buffer) so ram cannot get to much load and our application doesn't crash.But it take some time to transfer the data.
SO you can see it when you download something it doesn't download very quick



# Problem in node js 
We cannot read the data which is greater than the 2gb in node js
if we read the large data than their  is a sudden jump in the memmory
When we write a big size file in vs code and play that video than our memory usage increase very high
