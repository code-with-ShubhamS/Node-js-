// Middleware in Node.js refers to functions that execute before sending response and after request. These functions have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle.

// Application-level middleware: Bound to an instance of the express object.
// Router-level middleware: Bound to an instance of express.Router().
// Error-handling middleware: Specifically designed to handle errors.
// Built-in middleware: Provided by Express (e.g., express.json(), express.static()).
// Third-party middleware: Installed via npm (e.g., cors, body-parser).
