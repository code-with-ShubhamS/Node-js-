GitHub is a website and git is a tool. Mostly developer used git to push their code (using terminal) ;

upload file on git hub
git init
git status
git add .
git commit -m("initial commit")
git branch -M main  to rename master branch 
git remote add origin https://github.com/code-with-ShubhamS/News-Generator-.git
git push -u origin main  using -u we will push our code using (git push)


Use when we import file from GitHub and then push it 
git clone Link
git add .
git commit -m "Shubham Pushing it"
git push origin main 



BRANCH COMMANDS
git branch (to check the branch)
git branch -M main (to rename the branch)
git checkout branchName (to Navigate in branch )
git checkout -b new_Branch (to create a new branch)
git branch -d branch Name (to delete the branch )


MERGE CODE (ADDING BRANCHES CODE INTO MAIN)

if we merge two branches it doesn't show in the local host so you can simply pull all the changes.
git pull origin main


FIXIBG MISTAKE

1. Staged changes (Means we add a unwanted file)
git reset file Name 
git reset (to reset all the challenges)


2. Commited changes (for one commit)
git reset HEAD~1  (reset the last commit)


3. commited changes (for many commit)
git reset <-commit hash-> 
git reset --hard <-commit hash->

git long (show all the commits) 



FORK (a rough copy)
used in contribution 

fork-> repository create -> changes -> pull request to main file
