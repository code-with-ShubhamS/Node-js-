In node js when we declared variable using var keyword it go to local scope and 
when we declared that variable and connected it to html than that go to global variable.

# MODULES
Modules are the file and we are import it and used it.
It help us to maintain the main file.
Also help us to reuse the code.

# Note
When we require the file than first it will run that code and after that assingn to the variable which is in the main file
By Default the require return the module.exports value;

# How require function work
first it will check file if file is not present than it will throw an error;
Second it will execute that file 
Third export the function which is written in module.export
