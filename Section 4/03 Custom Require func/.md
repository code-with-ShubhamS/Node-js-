How Require function work; making our own require function 
1. Read the file 
2. than execute it 
3. return that code 

We can also use vm (virtual machine) instad of eval

const vm = require("vm")
vm.runInThisContext("var a=12");
vm run this code global scope where eval run their code in their own scope
