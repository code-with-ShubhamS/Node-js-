# Node Package module
NPM is a package manager used to install, delete, and update Javascript packages on your machine.	

NPM installs packages globally, which means that your machine may be polluted by packages that are not required anymore in the long run. 

To use create-react-app using NPM, we would first have to install it globally, and then run it, which makes using NPM in such cases redundant.



# Node package Execution 
The most common application of NPX is the create-react-app command. Since we only need to use it once, i.e., while initializing the project, we do not install it. 

NPX does not install packages, so package pollution on the machine is not a concern.

NPX is a package executer, and it is used to execute javascript packages directly, without installing them.



npm and npx are just javascript file behid the scene which is running using shabang
