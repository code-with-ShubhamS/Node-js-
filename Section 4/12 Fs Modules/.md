Differenc btw radfile and readfileSync 

readFileSync => work as a syncronously. means if first line is not executed than we cannot move to next line; And mostly we are not used readFileSync 


NOTE: IN READ-FILE-SYNC IT WILL BLOCK THE MAIN THREAD WHICH MEAN SETINTERVAL CODE IS NOT EXECUTED UNTIL MY FILE IS READ
