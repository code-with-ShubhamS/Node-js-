SheBang => we only use it in our bash,linux terminal. In powershell it doesn't work.

when we run command file in terminal by default it run as "bash ./command" 


A shebang is a special character sequence that appears at the beginning of a script file in Unix-like operating systems. It tells the computer how to interpret and run the file. The shebang is made up of the characters #!, which is a number sign (also known as a sharp or hash) and an exclamation mark (also known as a bang).
