# Port 
Whenever client send the req on ip addreess and there are multiple project is running on that ip address than the port is used to identify the exact website a client want

HTTP default port is 80 behind the scene 80 port is used for http and https used port 443

 It allows the operating system to distinguish between different applications and services that use the same network connection.

 # Why Ports Important
 1. Multiple Services on One IP Address
 2. Routing Data: When data arrives at a device, the port number in the packet tells the operating system which application or service should handle it.



# How Ports Work?
Example: A Web Browser Connecting to a Website
# Client Side:
1. A web browser (client) initiates a connection to a server using a specific port, typically port 80 (HTTP) or port 443 (HTTPS).
2. The operating system assigns a temporary source port (dynamic port) to the outgoing connection.
# Server Side:
1. The server listens on the specified port (e.g., 80 or 443) for incoming requests.
2. Upon receiving the request, it sends a response back to the clientâ€™s assigned source port.
