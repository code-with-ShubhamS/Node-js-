To communicate or transfer data from one computer to another, we need an address. In computer networks, various types of addresses are introduced; each works at a different layer. A MAC address, which stands for Media Access Control Address, is a physical address that works at the Data Link Layer.

MAC Addresses are unique 48-bit hardware numbers of a computer that are embedded into a network card (known as a Network Interface Card) during manufacturing.

NOT DYNAMIC 

like wifi,bluetooth, ethernet the static address is already define at manufacturing time.


In firewall we can handle the incoming and outgoing request .We can block any request

Device Identification:

Every device connected to a network has a unique MAC address, which allows devices to be identified on a local network.
Local Communication:

MAC addresses are used for communication within the same network segment or LAN (Local Area Network).
Devices on a local network communicate using MAC addresses, even if higher-level protocols (like IP) are in use.
Packet Delivery:

In a LAN, switches use MAC addresses to forward data packets to the correct destination device.
Network Security:

MAC addresses can be used in Access Control Lists (ACLs) or MAC filtering to permit or deny network access to specific devices.
Address Resolution:

The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) maps IP addresses to MAC addresses, enabling devices to send data on a network using IP at Layer 3 and MAC addresses at Layer 2.
