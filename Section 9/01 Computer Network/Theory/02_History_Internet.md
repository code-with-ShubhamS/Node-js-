Intranet => It is the network between Organization

cold war btw USA and RUSSIA

The U.S. Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) was the first public packet-switched computer network. It was first used in 1969 and finally decommissioned in 1989. ARPANET's main use was for academic and research purposes.

ARPANET was created to allow computers to communicate and share information over long distances. ARPANET was the first wide-area packet-switched network and one of the first to use the TCP/IP protocol suite

After this every organization started making their own intranet.

So we need somthing which connect all organization and enable communication btw them .Then TCP/IP procotocol is used .


# How We communicate through Mobile
Mobile communication is not fully wireless because the tower is communicating with each other through wire


Voice => digital signal => Electromagnetic waves => Tower => Destination Tower => Person receive call 


# DNS

A Domain Name System (DNS) turns domain names into IP addresses, which allow browsers to get to websites and other internet resources. Every device on the internet has an IP address, which other devices can use to locate the device.


First all the ip address are store in the single file and that file send to every organization computer so if they want to acces something they can access it .

After that we make a system in which all the Ip address are store and if anyone want to access than it will first write that computer ip address and than write the Domain name to access that computer which they want  to access.

At last we build dns with the talnet command so user can dirctly access the computer using talnet abc.com (DNS).


# WWW
