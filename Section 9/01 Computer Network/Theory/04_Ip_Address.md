Their is a diff btw IP and IP address

# Internet Protocol
The Internet Protocol (IP) is a protocol, or set of rules, for routing and addressing packets of data so that they can travel across networks and arrive at the correct destination


# Internet Protocol Address
Internet Protocol Adress provide address to every device which are connected to internet 

IPv4 => 32 bits

192.86.1.2 = 11000000 01010110 00000001 00000010
00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 

# Subnet Mast Address
A subnet mask is a four-octet number used to identify the network ID portion and hostname of a 32-bit IP address 

255.255.255.0 => 11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000
Here 1 denote the network id and 0 denote hostName

There are 2 pow 32 unique IP address are their 
IP address are of two types Private and Public

Their is one mistake which is create by scientist .The scientest reserved to much ip address btw 127.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255 for the local Host which doesn't required.
```
Wasted nearly 256×256×256 = 16,777,216 ip address. 
```
# Mackaddress cannot be change .The Mac Adress Define when the create the Device


Dynamic Ip address => which is assign by the network automatically
Static Ip Address => We can assign ip address of our own to our device so whenever they connect with that network than that ip address is used 


We know that every device has a unique ip address to connect through internet .But In a wifi a moderm has a unique public ip address and all the devices which are connnected through wifi mostly have private ip address in every house.

Public and private address increasae security and also reduce the use of ip address 

Dont show public ip address 
But we can show private ip address


Public ip address accessible over a network. we can make our server which is accessible over a network 


We can make our own server with the help of public ip address or we can make our system a server
