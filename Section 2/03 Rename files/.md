cat => used to print file data 
nano => is also used to change file data using commandLine (only in Bash Terminal)

vim => used to change file data using commandLine (only in Bash Terminal) 
vim is based on vi 

insert i;
save :w
exit :q
:q! : used to exit the file without saving it 

so these all command are used when we deploy our project because there is no gui interface to change the file then we use terminal 

DESKTOP@DESKTOP-SFQK4VR MINGW64 /e/Node js Cource/Section 2/03 Rename files  
This is called prompt 

we cam change the prompt according to developer using $PS1

if you want to change prompt permanently then you can use .bashrc file which is run whenever you open a bash terminal to change the prompt 



alias source = " command which can be run "
and whenerve we type source it will run that command
